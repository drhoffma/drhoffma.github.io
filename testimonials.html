        <p>"I had the pleasure to work with David on a critical project for one of the multi-billion dollar internet companies. David was an excellent Team Lead and an experienced Python Developer...he ensured himself and his team were working with high velocity and delivered high quality code. He was one of the 12 team leads that I had worked with using Agile Scrum methodology. 

During process changes within the organization, David quickly adapted and applied the new standards, coached others, and got everyone up-to-speed with the new changes. His communication skills were excellent across the management, development, and networking teams. He was easy to work with and was definitely a good team player. I highly recommend David to anyone in any company who is looking for a Team Lead with good technology skills."</p>

        <p>"I have known David as both a student in my classes and President of the Underwater Robotics Club (URC) at NC State University, for which I am an advisor. David is one of the most well-rounded engineers and leaders I have observed in a student. As a mentor to his Senior Design Project, I found him energetic, a great researcher of technology, and an excellent leader of the team. 

As President of the URC…David led the club to new heights as an organization with strong attention to organizing projects, preparing future leaders, and providing technical guidance in many areas. David is a true leader and an excellent practical engineer with skills in systems, hardware, and software design. I highly recommend David as a person and engineer."</p>
