        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm an engineer with 15+ years of Python experience, solving complex problems across robotics, electronics testing, network automation, computer vision, and cybersecurity. I drive product strategies that align innovation with business goals and lead teams to deliver impactful features and streamline workflows. I excel in global, cross-functional teams, translating technical concepts for engineers and business leaders. My expertise includes data pipelines, cybersecurity analytics, computer vision algorithms, and deep learning convolutional neural networks applied to computer vision. Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, bocce, and keeping up with technology trends (in particular, quantum computing interests me). Check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> for more details.</p>
