        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm an engineer with a diverse background, a passion for solving complex problems, and a track record of delivering impactful solutions. With 15+ years of Python experience, Iâ€™ve built and optimized systems across robotics, electronics testing, network analysis, computer vision, and cybersecurity. I leverage my engineering expertise to drive product strategies that align technical innovation with business goals, leading teams across the SDLC to deliver high-impact features and streamline workflows. I thrive in global, cross-functional teams and excel at translating complex technical concepts for engineers, architects, and business leaders. My expertise spans data pipelines, cybersecurity analytics, and AI-driven applications, where I extract meaningful insights to drive informed decisions. In my free time, I apply my analytical skills to designing trading algorithms and stay active through tennis and lifelong learning.
